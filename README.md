# org.roganov.milenage
  
A Clojure library designed to support Milenage algorithm calculations according to 3GPP TS 35.206. 
What is supporting:
 
 * `OPc` calculation based on `OP` and `K`
 * `f1`-`f5` functions including `f1*` and `f5*`
 * Algorithm customization with `R` and `C` constants
 * Only [Rijndael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) can be used as encryption algorithm at this moment
